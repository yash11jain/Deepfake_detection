        Deepfakes can be used to create highly convincing yet completely
        fabricated content. This poses a significant threat in the realm of
        information dissemination, as fake videos or audio clips can be
        circulated to deceive people into believing events that never occurred
        or statements that were never made. This can lead to the spread of
        false narratives, misinformation, and confusion among the public.
